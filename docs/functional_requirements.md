# Functional Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the functional requirements for the **AI-Powered Texture Manipulation Tool**. The application allows users to select objects in an image, generate AI-powered textures based on a text prompt, and apply the texture using different blending modes while preserving the original details.

## 2. User Stories
### 2.1 Selection & Editing
- **US1**: As a user, I want to **load an image** into the application.
- **US2**: As a user, I want to **select an area in the image** using a brush or polygon selection tool.
- **US3**: As a user, I want to **refine my selection** using an eraser tool or by adjusting the edges.
- **US4**: As a user, I want to **undo or redo actions** to correct mistakes.

### 2.2 Texture Generation
- **US5**: As a user, I want to **input a text description** (prompt) for the AI to generate a texture.
- **US6**: As a user, I want the AI to **generate a seamless texture** that fits the selected area.
- **US7**: As a user, I want the ability to **regenerate the texture** if I donâ€™t like the result.

### 2.3 Blending & Application
- **US8**: As a user, I want to **apply the generated texture** onto the selected area.
- **US9**: As a user, I want to **adjust the blending mode** (e.g., overlay, multiply, soft light) to control how the texture integrates with the original image.
- **US10**: As a user, I want to **adjust the opacity** of the applied texture.
- **US11**: As a user, I want to **manually fine-tune the blending** by painting over or masking parts of the texture.

### 2.4 Export & File Management
- **US12**: As a user, I want to **export the edited image** in various formats (PNG, JPG, etc.).
- **US13**: As a user, I want to **save my progress** as a project file for future editing.

## 3. Functional Specifications
### 3.1 Image Processing
- **Support for standard image formats**: JPG, PNG, BMP.
- **Selection tools**:
  - Freehand brush selection
  - Polygonal lasso selection
  - Automatic segmentation (future enhancement)
- **Blending Options**:
  - Overlay, Multiply, Soft Light, Normal.
  - Opacity control (0-100%).

### 3.2 AI Texture Generation
- **Text-to-texture AI model integration**:
  - Support for **Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Kandinsky, or custom models**.
  - Option to use pre-trained or fine-tuned models.
- **Input parameters for AI**:
  - Text prompt
  - Style settings (optional, e.g., photorealistic, cartoon, abstract)
  - Resolution constraints (to ensure performance efficiency)

### 3.3 User Interface
- **Main components**:
  - Image canvas for editing
  - Selection tools sidebar
  - AI prompt input box
  - Blend mode settings
  - Export and Save buttons
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for quick editing.

## 4. Performance & Constraints
- **Minimum hardware requirements**:
  - GPU recommended for AI processing.
  - 8GB+ RAM for efficient image editing.
- **AI processing time**:
  - Average texture generation time: **3-10 seconds**.
  - Batch processing support planned in future updates.

## 5. Error Handling
- **Invalid selections**: Prevent processing if no area is selected.
- **AI generation failures**: Display error message and allow retry.
- **File save issues**: Warn the user if there are permission or format errors.

## 6. Future Enhancements
- **Auto-selection using AI segmentation**.
- **Layer-based editing for multiple textures**.
- **History panel for better undo/redo functionality**.
